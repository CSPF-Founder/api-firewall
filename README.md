# API Firewall

Light-weighted Wallarm API Firewall protects your API endpoints in cloud-native environments with API schema validation. Wallarm API Firewall relies on a positive security model allowing calls that match a predefined API specification, while rejecting everything else.

API Firewall works as a reverse proxy with a built-in OpenAPI 3.0 request and response validator. The validator is written in Go and optimized for extreme performance and near-zero added latency.
